# Multi-Modal Facial Emotion Recognition

This repository contains code and reports for the **Multi-Modal Analysis of Facial Emotion Recognition by Correlating Digital Image Features and EEG Features** project.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Facial emotion recognition (FER) is an important application in affective computing. This project explores a multi-modal approach combining:
- **Digital Image Features**
- **EEG Features**
- **Digital Image Features**
  
Using **machine learning** and **deep learning**, we classify emotions based on these multi-modal features.
